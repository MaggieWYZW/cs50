Genrate notes from text description.

There are three functions inplemented in the helpers.c code.
1. duration: calculates the duration of each note or the duration of a rest
2. is_rest: determins if there's a rest
3. frequency: calculates the frequency of each note
(Other than these implementation, the rest are previously provided by cs50.)

Makefile is written for compling the source code.
synthesize is reads a .txt file and writes a .wav file which can be played.
